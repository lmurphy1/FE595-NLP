The sentiment analysis of company names shows that the most negative scores are often determined by certain keywords. For example, the most negative companies all have the word killer in their description and all have the same score. In the context of the company descriptions, however, killer should really be considered a positive word. Overall there are not many negatively scored companies, which makes sense given the dataset of company descriptions. On the other hand, the top positive companies have more variety in the words within their descriptions, as the VADER lexicon probably has more of these positive words in it.
